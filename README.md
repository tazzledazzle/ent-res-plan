# ent-res-plan
practice building an enterprise resource planning suite


The system includes these key features:

1. Bill of Materials (BOM) management with component tracking
2. Work order creation and scheduling
3. Resource capacity planning and allocation
4. Workflow management with step dependencies
5. Project tracking with metrics
6. Time and expense logging
7. Inventory management with material reservation

To extend the system, you could:

* Add a database layer (e.g., SQLAlchemy)
* Implement a REST API (e.g., FastAPI)
* Add user authentication and authorization
* Create a web interface
* Add reporting and analytics features

# Manufacturing ERP System Design Document

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The Manufacturing ERP System is designed to provide integrated management of business processes for a small-sized computer integrated manufacturing company. The system manages bill of materials, work orders, scheduling, capacity planning, workflow management, project planning, and performance tracking.

### 1.2 Scope
The system encompasses:
- Bill of Materials (BOM) Management
- Work Order Processing
- Production Scheduling
- Resource Capacity Planning
- Workflow Management
- Project Management
- Time and Expense Tracking
- Inventory Management
- Performance Analytics
- User Management and Authentication

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- Backend:
  - Python/FastAPI for REST API
  - PostgreSQL for database
  - SQLAlchemy for ORM
  - JWT for authentication
- Frontend:
  - KotlinJS with React wrappers
  - Kotlin Coroutines for async operations
  - React Router for navigation
  - Emotion for styling

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
The system follows a multi-tier architecture:
1. Presentation Layer (KotlinJS/React)
2. API Layer (FastAPI)
3. Business Logic Layer (Python Services)
4. Data Access Layer (SQLAlchemy)
5. Database Layer (PostgreSQL)

### 2.2 Component Diagram
```
[Web Interface (KotlinJS)] ←→ [REST API (FastAPI)] ←→ [Business Services] ←→ [Database]
         ↑                            ↑                         ↑
         |                            |                         |

    Components                   JWT Auth                Data Validation
    State Management            Rate Limiting           Workflow Engine
```

## 3. Database Design

### 3.1 Core Entities
- Users
- Materials
- BillOfMaterials
- WorkOrders
- Projects
- Resources
- TimeEntries
- ExpenseEntries
- Workflows
- WorkflowSteps

### 3.2 Key Relationships
- Project → WorkOrders (1:N)
- BillOfMaterials → Materials (M:N)
- WorkOrder → Resources (M:N)
- Project → Workflow (1:1)
- WorkOrder → Materials (M:N through MaterialUsage)

## 4. API Design

### 4.1 Authentication
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/refresh
- POST /api/auth/logout

### 4.2 Core Endpoints
- Projects API
  - GET /api/projects
  - POST /api/projects
  - GET /api/projects/{id}
  - PUT /api/projects/{id}
  - DELETE /api/projects/{id}

- Work Orders API
  - GET /api/work-orders
  - POST /api/work-orders
  - GET /api/work-orders/{id}
  - PUT /api/work-orders/{id}
  - DELETE /api/work-orders/{id}

- Resources API
  - GET /api/resources
  - POST /api/resources
  - GET /api/resources/{id}
  - PUT /api/resources/{id}
  - DELETE /api/resources/{id}

### 4.3 Analytics Endpoints
- GET /api/analytics/project-metrics/{id}
- GET /api/analytics/resource-utilization
- GET /api/analytics/inventory-status

## 5. Security Design

### 5.1 Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Token refresh mechanism
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### 5.2 Authorization Roles
- ADMIN: Full system access
- MANAGER: Project and resource management
- WORKER: Time entry and work order updates

### 5.3 Security Measures
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- HTTPS encryption
- API rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through ORM
- CORS configuration
